# spartronicsgif

Animated GIF of the Spartronics logo.

`generate_gif.py` must be called from the command line using

```cmd
python generate_gif.py duration
```

where `duration` is the duration of each frame in ms. (There are 45 frames)

requires PIL. run

```
pip install Pillow
```

to install!

Modify `generate_gif` to use different files -- change the file reference in line 5 or line 7; change filename in line 19 to make a differently named file.
